/// A memory buffer providing amortized O(1) performance for operations on its stored elements at both start and end
/// positions.
///
/// This reference type can suit as the underlaying buffer of `MutableCollection` value types needing to perform O(1)
/// for operations of insertion and removal on both, the first and last elements.
/// For example `Array` performs in O(1) on operations involving removal/insertion of its last element,
/// but only O(*n*) on its first element (where *n* is the number of elements successive the first one).
/// That's due to the fact that `Array` has to shift elements successive its first one in order to keep its indexing order intact.
/// On the other hand, `CircularBuffer` uses a clever *head* and *tail* internal indexes system which makes possible
/// not to shift elements when removing/inserting at the first and last indexes.
/// `CircularBuffer` provides functionalities for storing and removing elements which may overwrite
/// elements previously stored when its storage capacity has been filled-up, allowing it be used effectively as a ring-buffer.
/// It also provides functionalities for storing and removing new elements with the increase/decrease of the storage capacity.
/// These latter functionalities might as well be used in conjuction with the *smart capacity policy*,
/// that is a strategy for increasing/decreasing the capacity of the storage so that the operations
/// for elements addition/removal won't trigger the resize of the underlaying memory buffer too often,
/// hence not affecting the overall performance of those operations.
